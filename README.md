# LanguageLab Library DRF

This app allows instructors to create exercises involving audio mimicry.  The
primary use case that I envison is for language lab type activities, but this
could also be used to practice dialect or gender speech, song or even
instrumental music.

There are two parts to the application: the backend *Library*, written in Python
to work with Django, and the frontend *Client*, written in Javascript to work
with React.

## Hosting media

LanguageLab is not a media server.  It presents exercises to the user based on
URLs pointing to media files hosted elsewhere.  For copyright purposes, these
media files can be protected with a .htaccess password.  It is relatively easy
to add media server functionality if desired.

## Serving the client in production

In production, the Javascript client should be served using a separate virtual
directory, or even a separate server.

## Requirements

The full list of Library requirements is in [requirements.txt](requirements.txt),
but the main requirements are Django, the Django Rest Framework and
Django-taggit.  The Client requirements are in
[languagelab/static/package.json](/languagelab/static/package.json)
and include React, React-DOM, Moment.js, Bootstrap (requires jQuery) and the
Open Iconic icon library.

## Installation

These steps work for PythonAnywhere.  They should also work for other hosts,
with minor modifications.

* Clone this repository to your server
* Create a virtual environment for your application
* Activate the virtual environment
* Set up a web server.  If you are using Apache with mod_wsgi, you should add
  `WSGIPassAuthorization On` to your httpd configuration
* If you are using mod_wsgi, you should also add your virtual environment to
  your path, e.g. with `sys.path.append()` in your wsgi.py file
* Install Python dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
* Install the Javascript and CSS dependencies:
  `npm install --prefix=languagelab/static`
* Create a database and a database user with rights to that database
* Copy `languagelab/django_environ_empty.py` to `languagelab/django_environ.py`
* Edit `languagelab/django_environ.py` and fill in the details of your
  installation, including the database
* Copy `languagelab/static/client/environment_empty.js` to
  `languagelab/static/client/environment.js`
* Edit `languagelab/static/client/environment.js` and fill in the API hostname
* Copy the static files including admin site styling:
  `python manage.py collectstatic`
* Run `python manage.py makemigrations languagelab`
* Run `python manage.py migrate`
* Run `python manage.py loaddata languagelab/api/fixtures/languages.json` to get
  the most common languages
* Create a superuser:
  `python manage.py createsuperuser --username=joe --email=joe@example.com`
* Restart your web server
