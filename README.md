# LanguageLab Library DRF

This app allows instructors to create exercises involving audio mimicry.  The
primary use case that I envison is for language lab type activities, but this
could also be used to practice dialect or gender speech, song or even
instrumental music.

There are two parts to the application: the backend *Library*, written in Python
to work with Django, and the frontend *Client*, written in Javascript to work
with React.

## Requirements

The full list of Library requirements is at [requirements.txt], but the main
requirements are Django, the Django Rest Framework and Django-taggit.  The
Client requirements are as follows:

* React and React-DOM
* Moment.js
* Bootstrap (requires jQuery)

## INSTALLATION

* Set up an email account for registration, if necessary
* Clone this repository to your server
* Create a virtual environment for your application
* Activate the virtual environment
* Install Python dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
* Download the Javascript and CSS dependencies and copy them to the `static`
    directory (this will be done automatically in the future)
* Copy `languagelab/django_environ_empty.py` to `languagelab/django_environ.py`
* Edit `languagelab/django_environ.py` and fill in the details of your installation
* Copy `languagelab/static/client/environment_empty.js` to `languagelab/static/client/environment.js`
* Edit `languagelab/static/client/environment.js` and fill in the API hostname
* Copy the static files including admin site styling: `python manage.py collectstatic`
* Run `python manage.py makemigrations languagelab`
* Run `python manage.py migrate`
* Run `python manage.py loaddata languagelab/api/fixtures/languages.json`
* If you want languages that aren't on the language list, download them
* Create a superuser: `python manage.py createsuperuser --username=joe --email=joe@example.com`
* Restart your web server
* Log in to `/admin`, create your domain and delete `example.com` so that the links in the activation emails will work
* Change the `DJANGO_SITE_ID` value in your `django_environ.py` to the ID of the site you just created (probably 2)
